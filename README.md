# Should I Really Deploy Today?

I've been rather tired of the negative tropes associated with Software
Engineering. Recently, a colleague shared
[shouldideploy.today](https://shouldideploy.today). There's something
about this kind of humor --- I'm not sure what the name of it is, perhaps
"livin' the dream" humor --- that sucks the life out of me.

There's a lot that could fill into a whole Manifesto here, but I'll just leave it at:

**Yes...** ***that's why you made it.***

### License

No license, because just a single page with intro to CSS and HTML 101 kind
of content. You're welcome to it. That said, BAT tips are always appreciated if
you think this is funny or inspiring.
