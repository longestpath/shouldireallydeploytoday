# Should I Really Deploy Today?

Recently, a colleague shared [shouldideploy.today](https://shouldideploy.today).
Now, that site doesn't have only negative answers, but I viewed it on a
Thursday and Friday, and the overwhelming "No's" kind of rubbed me the
wrong way. Sort of as a "trope" or "livin' the dream" kind of sentiment.

So...

**Yes...** ***that's why you made it.***

### License

No license, because just a single page with intro to CSS and HTML 101 kind
of content. You're welcome to it. That said, BAT tips are always appreciated if
you think this is funny or inspiring.
