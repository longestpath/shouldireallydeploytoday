# Should I Really Deploy Today?

I've been rather tired of the negative tropes associated with Software
Engineering. Recently, a colleague shared
[shouldideploy.today](https://shouldideploy.today). Now, that site site
doesn't have only negative answers, but I viewed it on a Thursday and
Friday, and the overwhelming "No's" kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

This is a kind of humor I hear every now and then, but there's something
about it --- I'm not even sure what the name of it is, perhaps "livin' the
dream" humor --- that sucks the life out of me.

This is something I want to explore through a longer format thing, so I'll
just leave it at:

**Yes...** ***that's why you made it.***

### License

No license, because just a single page with intro to CSS and HTML 101 kind
of content. You're welcome to it. That said, BAT tips are always appreciated if
you think this is funny or inspiring.
