# Should I Really Deploy Today?

Inspired by the pessimism of the Software Engineer trope of "Oh goodness,
no. That's how you break things." that is adopted by
[shouldideploy.today](https://shouldideploy.today) and other similar sites.

## A bit more explanation...

As Software Engineers, our job and our passion is to make things. Almost
every one of us works on software that is not life-threatening. Try as we
may discussing things like feature location, impact analysis, automated
testing, BDD,TDD, static analysis, and a host of other things... there's
no substitute for you, a professional, and your gut.

We are designers, craftspeople, communicators, and need to take pride in
our work, our process, and our occupation.

A Software Professional must:
- Remain vigilant in every line of code written
- Measure twice, cut once (run your dang code before you deploy)
- Protect against mistakes at every turn
- Automate testing that will catch you
- ...and many others

The art of software is something that folks have written extensively on
and I'm not about to rehash the airy musings of a modern philosopher.

Our work is practical, dirty, crafty, and only as expensive to deploy as
we make it. If it fails, do it again, roll it back, take pride in your
abilities, don't waste your life being scared to deploy nor staying late.

Keep living, honor your craft, and ask yourself... should I deploy? I'm
here to say ABSOLUTELY, THAT'S WHY YOU MADE IT.

### License

There is no license, because this is a single page that just tells you to
do it. I guess if you want to steal my few lines of CSS and HTML intor,
you're welcome to it. That said, I'd appreciate a BAT tip if you think this is funny
or inspiring.
